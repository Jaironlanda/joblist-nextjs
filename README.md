![Sample](/screenshots/joblist-sample-v2.gif)

## Tech Stacks

1. [NextJS (14+)](https://nextjs.org/)
2. [TailwindCSS (DaisyUI) v4](https://daisyui.com/)
3. [HeroIcons](https://heroicons.com/)
## Setup

1. If you haven't already, you can [sign up](https://jsonsilo.com/user/signup) for a jsonsilo.com account.
2. Once your registration is completed and your email is verified, get ready to dive in!
3. Create your first Silo (it's FREE!). Copy and paste the JSON template below, and click the `Next` button to deploy your amazing static JSON API.
4. Clone this awesome template with the following command:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JSONSilo/joblist-template
    ```
5. Now, let's make it yours! Rename `.env-temp` to `.env.local.` Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_SILO_URL`. 
    You can get this URL after deployment or in Silo Management. It should look something like this: `https://api.jsonsilo.com/public/<UUID>`.

7. Are you feeling the excitement building up? 😄
8. Run the magic command:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

And voila! Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to witness the awesomeness. 🎉
